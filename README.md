# Tumour-Check

This project explores the usage of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in classifying MRI images to determine if the image indicates presence of tumour or no tumour in the brain of patients. Aside from predicting the presence of tumour in patients, it also explores possible ideas of programming architecture and data pipeline in preparation to load MRI images for training the model and predicting the images.

## Introduction/Background

This small-scale project materialised from my random thoughts about healthcare industry, where the processes and systems can be digitalised to improve efficiency. Currently, Singapore healtcare and medical industry is currently facing manpower shortage, with additional burdence of future expected increase in demand for manpower in the near future. With ideas to explore the possibilities of improving the efficiency of systems in healthcare industry to combat the manpower shortage, I decided to program out data pipeline and an MRI image Classification model made using CNN to aid doctors and medical staffs in reducing workflow time or providing opportunities for further manpower optimisation.

## Features

Predicting if patient has tumour or no tumour based on MRI Image.
